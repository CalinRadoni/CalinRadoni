# Hi, I am Calin Radoni

**... and I know that I should insert a nice image here** &#x1F643;

and I like to build things.

Now I am working with ESP32, WS2812* LEDs and ESP-IDF. The current hardware and software projects are:

- [pax-LampD1](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/pax-LampD1)
- [pax-Gateway](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/pax-Gateway)

For those I have built some ESP-IDF components like:

- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32BoardManager
- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32RMT
- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32Timers
- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32HAL
- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32SimpleOTA
- https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32DLEDController

Not as much as I want, I am writing about various subjects at [CalinRadoni.github.io](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/CalinRadoni.github.io)

At work I am doing mostly system engineering, network administration, engineering and security.
