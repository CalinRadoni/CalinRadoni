# Hi, I am Calin Radoni

**... and I know that I should insert a nice image here** &#x1F643;

and I like to build things.

The newest projects are:

- [CreamCSS](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/CreamCSS)<br/>*Lightweight, Classless, HTML Semantic Elements, Responsive, Mobile First CSS framework*<br/>CSS, 2 stars
- [RobotT1](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/RobotT1)<br/>*A Telegram Bot hosted on a ESP32 board with esp32-camera and some sensors*<br/>C++, one star

and because some scripts may be worth keeping around:

- [Scripts](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/Scripts)<br/>Shell
- [ansible-ubuntu-workstation](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ansible-ubuntu-workstation)<br/>*Roles meant to be used after a basic Ubuntu installation: custom keyboard layouts, vscode and extensions, dconf and common ones*<br/>Python

I am also working with ESP32, WS2812* LEDs and ESP-IDF, for those the current hardware and software projects are:

- [pax-LampD1](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/pax-LampD1)<br/>*A lamp based on pax-DLED and 2 x 100 WS2812B LED strips*<br/>C++, one star, one fork
- [pax-Gateway](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/pax-Gateway)<br/>KiCad Layout, one fork

For those I have built two GitHub Actions as a side project:

- [esp-idf-v4-container-action](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/esp-idf-v4-container-action) *GitHub Action to build your ESP32 code using the official Docker container from Espressif.*<br/>Dockerfile, 3 stars, 5 forks
- [esp-idf-v4-action](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/esp-idf-v4-action) *GitHub Action to build your ESP32 firmware with ESP-IDF development framework v4.x*<br/>Shell, 5 stars, 6 forks

and some ESP-IDF components like:

- [ESP32BoardManager](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32BoardManager) *Basic board manager with WiFi AP / STA mode, HTTP server and firmware OTA update*<br/>C++, 7 stars, 3 forks
- [ESP32DLEDController](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32DLEDController) *ESP32 controller for WS2812 LEDs*<br/>C++, 10 stars, 4 forks
- [ESP32HAL](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32HAL) *ESP32 HAL: helper C++ classes for some ESP32 info (tasks, heap) and generic peripherals (ADC, GPIO, I2C, SPI, Timers, ...)*<br/>C++, 7 stars, 4 forks
- [ESP32RMT](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32RMT) *Helper component for ESP32 Remote Control module*<br/>C++, one star, 3 forks
- [ESP32SimpleOTA](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/ESP32SimpleOTA) *Helper component for ESP32 Over The Air firmware updates*<br/>C++, 2 stars, one fork


Not as much as I want, I am writing about various subjects at [CalinRadoni.github.io](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/CalinRadoni.github.io)

At work I am doing mostly system engineering, network administration, engineering and security.
