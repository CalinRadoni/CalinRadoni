# Hi, I am Calin Radoni

**... and I know that I should insert a nice image here** &#x1F643;

and I like to build things.

Now I am working with ESP32, WS2812* LEDs and ESP-IDF. The current hardware and software projects are:

{% set repo = info.get_repo("pax-LampD1") -%}
- {{ info.get_repo_namelink_md(repo, True) }}<br/>{{ info.get_repo_info(repo) }}
{% set repo = info.get_repo("pax-Gateway") -%}
- {{ info.get_repo_namelink_md(repo, True) }}<br/>{{ info.get_repo_info(repo) }}

For those I have built a GitHub Action as a side project:

{% set repo = info.get_repo("esp-idf-v4-action") -%}
- {{ info.get_repo_namelink_md(repo, False) }}<br/>{{ info.get_repo_info(repo) }}

and some ESP-IDF components like:

{% for repo in info.esp_components -%}
- {{ info.get_repo_namelink_md(repo, False) }}<br/>{{ info.get_repo_info(repo) }}
{% endfor %}

Not as much as I want, I am writing about various subjects at [CalinRadoni.github.io](https://github.com/CalinRadoni/CalinRadoni.github.io)

At work I am doing mostly system engineering, network administration, engineering and security.
